# Santander ♨️♨️
A reimagination of the Santander website created to study Angular and test it. <br>

<h3>How to load it locally?</h3>
Well, if you want to change it or use it outside of GitHub Pages, first you need to download <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">npm</a>
or <a href="https://yarnpkg.com/">yarn</a> package managers.<br><br>

After this, download the repository or clone it using git. You can clone using this:
```diff
git clone https://github.com/PlopesK/Santander
```
Then, go inside the project folder and digit inside a terminal:
```diff
npm install
```
or
```diff
yarn install
```
This will start downloading the project dependecies. You can test it locally by executing:
```diff
ng serve -o
```
<s>```-o``` is used to open it when the project servers are ready.</s>
